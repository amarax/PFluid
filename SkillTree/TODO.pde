// Refactor stuff to have proper Model View Controller structure






// Make Overlays update and draw their own child UIControls  OK
//// Also manage them?


// Polish filters
//// Text should be drawn like other arc-anchored text
//// Needs to work with line mode as well

//// Re-arrange filters  OK
//// Improve drag point (dragging far from center increases distance from text)

// Fix cirle/line mode transition.
//// Blend starting point across TWO-PI-0 gap


// Experiment with motion blur.
